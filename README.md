# autohotkey-config

Misc helpers I use to avoid going insane from having to deal with Windows 11 settings.

## Changelog

- 2021-12-05: setsound - keyboard hotkeys for switching sound device.
  Depends on [SoundVolumeView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html) for enumerating and switching audio device. Could probably be implemented using direct DLL calls instead.
